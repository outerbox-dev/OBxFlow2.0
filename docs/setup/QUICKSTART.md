# OBxFlow Quick Start Guide

**Get up and running with N8N in 5 minutes**

---

## Prerequisites

✅ Docker Desktop installed and running  
✅ Terminal/Command line access  
✅ Git (for cloning repository)

---

## Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/outerbox-dev/OBxFlow2.0.git
cd OBxFlow2.0/n8n
```

---

## Step 2: Run Setup Script

The automated setup script will:
- Generate secure credentials
- Create your `.env` file
- Validate configuration
- Optionally start services

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

**Follow the prompts!** The script will:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Generate encryption key
3. Generate secure passwords
4. Create `.env` file
5. Ask if you want to start services now

**💾 Save your credentials!** The script displays them once - store in a password manager.

---

## Step 3: Access N8N

If you started services during setup, N8N is ready at:

```
http://localhost:5678
```

**Login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: (shown during setup)

---

## Manual Start (If Needed)

If you didn't auto-start during setup:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

View logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
